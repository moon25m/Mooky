Deployment heartbeat: 2025-11-05 — no-op change to trigger Vercel redeploy on main.

---

## Wishes – Ops Notes

Environment
- Set `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables (Production).
- Do not expose it to the client; server-only.

API endpoints
- `GET /api/wish` (Node): returns latest 100 rows. Headers include `Cache-Control: no-store` to bypass CDN/browser caches.
- `POST /api/wish` (Node): inserts `{ name?, message }` and returns the created row `{ id, name, message, created_at }`.
- `GET /api/wishes/stream` (Edge): server-sent events for live updates.
- `GET /api/wishes/debug` (Edge): connectivity + row count.

Observability
- Vercel → Deployments → Functions: see logs. Look for `POST /api/wish` and `GET /api/wish` entries.
- Errors include full messages; POST logs payload length not content.

Local dev quick test
```bash
bash scripts/dev-test.sh
```

Production quick test (set DEPLOY_URL or use default)
```bash
bash scripts/prod-test.sh
```

Expected responses
- `POST /api/wish` → `201 { ok: true, data: { id, name, message, created_at } }`
- `GET /api/wish` → `200 { ok: true, data: [ ... ] }`

Client behavior
- Optimistic add on send; live SSE updates; periodic refresh every 8s and on focus; newest first.
